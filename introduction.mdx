## What is Broccoli?

Broccoli is a CLI tool that uses [brotli compression](https://github.com/google/brotli) to embed a virtual file system of static files inside Go executables. It generates Go code that bundles your assets directly into your binary, making deployment simple and distribution self-contained.

With a single `go:generate` directive, Broccoli compresses and embeds files like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and WASM modules into your Go application.

  <Card
    title="Superior Compression"

  >
    13-25% smaller binary size compared to gzip-based alternatives thanks to brotli compression

  <Card
    title="Optional Decompression"
    icon="memory"
  >
    Files are decompressed only when first read, reducing memory usage for large asset bundles
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="WASM Compatible"

    Automatically respect existing .gitignore rules with the -gitignore flag
  </Card>

## How It Works

1. **Add a go:generate directive** to your Go code specifying source directories
2. **Run `go generate`** to compress and bundle assets into a .gen.go file
3. **Use the generated variable** to access files via a virtual file system API
4. **Build your application** - assets are now embedded in the binary

```go
//go:generate broccoli -src=public -o assets

func main() {
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", assets.Serve("public"))
}
```

## Performance Comparison

Broccoli outperforms existing Go asset embedding solutions:

| Feature | fileb0x | broccoli |
| ------- | ------- | -------- |
| Compression | gzip | brotli (-20% avg.) |
| Optional decompression | yes | yes |
| Compression levels | yes | yes (1-11) |
| .gitignore support | no | yes |
| Virtual memory file system | yes | yes |
| HTTP file system | yes | yes |
| WASM/JS compatible | limited | yes |

<Note>
Broccoli achieves an average of **13-25% smaller binary sizes** compared to gzip-based solutions while maintaining compatibility with standard Go interfaces like `http.FileSystem`.
