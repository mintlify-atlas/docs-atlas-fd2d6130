## Prerequisites

Before installing Broccoli, ensure you have:

- **Go 1.11 or later** (for Go modules support)
- **Git** (for go get to fetch the package)

## Install via go get

Install Broccoli globally using the `go get` command:

```bash
go get -u aletheia.icu/broccoli
```

This downloads, compiles, and installs the `broccoli` binary to your `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

<Note>
Make sure `$GOPATH/bin` is in your system's PATH so you can run the `broccoli` command from anywhere.
</Note>

## Verify Installation

Confirm that Broccoli is installed correctly by running:

```bash
broccoli
```

You should see the help output:

```
Usage: broccoli [options]

Broccoli uses brotli compression to embed a virtual file system in Go executables.

Options:
	-src folder[,file,file2]
		The input files and directories, "public" by default.
	-o
		Name of the generated file, follows input by default.
	-var=br
		Name of the exposed variable, "br" by default.
	-include *.html,*.css
		Wildcard for the files to include, no default.
	-exclude *.wasm
		Wildcard for the files to exclude, no default.
	-opt
		Optional decompression: if enabled, files will only be decompressed
		on the first time they are read.
	-gitignore
		Enables .gitignore rules parsing in each directory, disabled by default.
	-quality [level]
		Brotli compression level (1-11), the highest by default.
```

## Import the FS Package

In your Go code, you'll also need to import the Broccoli file system package:

```go
import "aletheia.icu/broccoli/fs"
```

Go modules will automatically fetch this dependency when you run `go build` or `go mod tidy`.

## Alternative: Install from Source
